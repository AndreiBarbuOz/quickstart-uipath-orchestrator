With UiPath Orchestrator, you can securely schedule, manage, and control your entire enterprise-wide digital workforce of UiPath robots. Orchestrator is also the integration point with third-party applications, managing the creation, monitoring, and deployment of all robotic process automation (RPA) resources in your environment.

UiPath Orchestrator can manage your entire robot fleet, including the following robot types: 

* *Attended* - A robot triggered by user events, operating alongside a human user, and sharing the same workstation. Used with UiPath Orchestrator for centralized process deployment and logging. They can also add data into a queue that is processed by unattended robots.
* *Unattended* - A robot that runs without human supervision in a virtual environment. They run, monitor, schedule, and support work queues remotely.
* *Development* - An unattended robot used only for development purposes.
* *Nonproduction* - An unattended robot used only for development and testing purposes.

UiPath robots can be connected and run from the central point UiPath Orchestrator provides. Also, you can run debugging in UiPath Studio with all types of robots.

With this Quick Start, you can deploy Orchestrator, UiPath database, and NuGet automation packages in an architecture based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. AWS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, and scales the robots to meet your specific workload. This Quick Start also offers a single-node and a multi-node option, with which you can deploy up to 20 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for the Orchestrator web application.
