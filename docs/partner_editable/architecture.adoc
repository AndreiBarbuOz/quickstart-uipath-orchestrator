.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or more  Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public  and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with  your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
    ** A Windows bastion host in each Availability Zone with a single security  group as a virtual firewall.
    ** AWS Storage Gateway providing a file gateway VM image.
    ** An Amazon EC2 instance hosting the file gateway.
    ** A security group to control traffic into the file  gateway.
* In the private subnets:
    ** An Auto Scaling group with up to 20 UiPath  Orchestrator nodes on Amazon EC2 instances running Windows Server 2019.
    ** An RDS DB instance in a database subnet group running  SQL Server for the UiPath database.
    ** An Application Load Balancer to balance traffic between  UiPath Orchestrator nodes.
    ** A  three-node cluster of EC2 instances running Red Hat Enterprise Linux for the High-availability add-on for UiPath Orchestrator.
* AWS Certificate Manager for  domain registration with a Secure Sockets Layer certificate.
* Amazon Route 53 as Domain Name System provider to route  traffic to an Application Load Balancer.
* Amazon CloudWatch for log collection, storage, and  analysis, and to enable complete visibility of robots and automation  tasks.
* Amazon S3 bucket to store NuGet packages, the  automation projects run by UiPath software robots.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role granting  access to the S3 bucket to AWS Storage Gateway.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
