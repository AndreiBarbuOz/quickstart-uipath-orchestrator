.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two (or more) Availability Zone.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
** S3 bucket for storage of the NuGet packages (the automations that are executed by the robots are delivered through Orchestrator)
** S3 File Storage Gateway to enable easy access to S3 files via a mapped network drive
* In the private subnets: 
** There are two deployment options. Under single-node option, it creates the following:
*** An EC2 instance, based on Windows Server 2019, for Orchestrator Web app
*** An RDS instance with SQL server for UiPath database
** Under multi-node option for high availability, it creates the following:
*** Autoscaling group with up to 20 EC2 instances, based on Windows Server 2019, for Orchestrator Web app
*** An RDS instance with SQL server for UiPath database
*** An Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic in a Round Robin algorithm between the Orchestrator nodes
*** High Availability Add-on for Orchestrator â€“ a 3 nodes cluster with Linux machines, for the in-memory database that is used as shared cache by all the Orchestrator instances

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
