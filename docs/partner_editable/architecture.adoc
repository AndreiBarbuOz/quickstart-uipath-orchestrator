image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host to allow inbound RDP access to EC2 instances in private subnets.
** S3 bucket for storage of NuGet packages, the automation routines executed by UiPath robots.
* In the private subnets:
** Only multi-node option for high availability is available and it creates the following:
*** Autoscaling group with up to 20 EC2 instances, based on Windows Server 2019, for Orchestrator Web app
*** An RDS instance with SQL server for UiPath database
*** An Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic in a Round Robin algorithm between the Orchestrator nodes
*** High Availability add-on (HAA) for UiPath Orchestrator, a cluster of three Amazon EC2 Linux instances for the in-memory database used as shared cache by Orchestrator instances in the Auto Scaling group.
*** S3 File Storage Gateway to enable easy access to S3 files via a mapped network drive


* A highly available architecture that spans up to three Availability Zones.*
* An Amazon Route 53-hosted zone, including associated records with a weighted policy for Domain Name System (DNS)-based load balancing.
* An internet gateway for connecting users to the AWS Cloud.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:
