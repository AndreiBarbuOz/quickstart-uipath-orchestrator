.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or more Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
** An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for NuGet packages, the automation projects run by UiPath software robots.
** AWS Storage Gateway for access to files in the S3 bucket via a mapped network drive.
* In the private subnets: 
*** An Auto Scaling group with up to 20 Amazon EC2 instances, based on Windows Server 2019, for UiPath Orchestrator.
*** An RDS DB instance with SQL server for the UiPath database.
*** An Application Load Balancer to balance traffic in a round-robin algorithm between UiPath Orchestrator nodes.
*** High Availability Add-on for UiPath Orchestrator in a three-node cluster of EC2 instances with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). These instances are for the in-memory database that is used as shared cache by the UiPath Orchestrator instances.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
