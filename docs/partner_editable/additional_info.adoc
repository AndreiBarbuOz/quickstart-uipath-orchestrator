== Create a key pair

Create a key pair in your preferred region. To do this, in the navigation pane of the Amazon EC2 console, choose Key Pairs, Create Key Pair, type a name, and then choose Create.
Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To be able to log into your instances, you must create a key pair. With Windows instances, we use the key pair to obtain the administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as explained in the step-by-step instructions in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. On Linux, we use the key pair to authenticate SSH login.

== Create IAM User
To launch the Cloudformation stack for this quickstart, you’ll need to use a user login that has programmatic access to following AWS services:

["lowerroman"]
. AWS CloudFormation
. AWS IAM, Amazon EC2
. Amazon S3
. Amazon RDS
. Amazon Route53
. AWS Certificate Manager
. AWS Elastic Load Balancer
. AWS Lambda
. AWS Storage Gateway.

If you do already have an IAM user that has full access to the above services, or have Admin access, you can skip this step.

. If you do not already have such an IAM user, create an IAM user from AWS console. In the example below, a user “cfnuser” is being created allowing programmatic access and console access.

[start=2]
. In order to follow AWS best practices, allow access to the required services. In order to do so, you can choose to attach existing policies. Then type first few letters of each service name and select to choose the FullAccess roles from the filtered list. The example here shows the screen for adding AmazonEC2FullAccess.

== Purchase UiPath License

This Quick Start uses AWS owned AMI. However, during initiation of EC2 VMs, it downloads, installs and configures UiPath Orchestrator and HA Addon software. In order to do so, you need to first purchase the license keys by https://www.uipath.com/company/contact-us[contacting UiPath directly].
