== Create a key pair
Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To be able to log into your instances, you must create a key pair. With Windows instances, a key pair is used to obtain the administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then to log in using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). On Linux, a key pair is used to authenticate SSH login. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Documentation].

To create a key pair in your preferred Region, do the following:

[start=1]
. In your AWS Management Console, choose an AWS Region.
. Choose *Services > EC2 > Network & Security > Key Pairs*, and then choose *Create Key Pair*.
. Enter a name and choose *Create*.

== Create IAM user

To launch the Cloudformation stack for this Quick Start, you’ll need a user login with programmatic access to following AWS services:

* AWS CloudFormation
* AWS IAM, Amazon EC2
* Amazon S3
* Amazon RDS
* Amazon Route53
* AWS Certificate Manager
* AWS Elastic Load Balancer
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Storage Gateway.

NOTE: If you do already have an IAM user with full access to these services, or have administrator access, you can skip this section.

[start=1]
:xrefstyle: short
. If you do not already have such an IAM user, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console[create one] from AWS console. In <<cfnuser>>, a user is created with programmatic and console access.

== Purchase UiPath license

This Quick Start uses AWS owned AMI. However, during initiation of EC2 VMs, it downloads, installs and configures UiPath Orchestrator and HA Addon software. In order to do so, you need to first purchase the license keys by https://www.uipath.com/company/contact-us[contacting UiPath directly].

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading
Verify that UiPath Orchestrator is deployed successfully by navigating to the Application Load Balancer endpoint URL. The *Login* screen shown in <<test1>> should display.

=== High availability and disaster recovery
Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Regions are dispersed and located in separate geographic areas. Availability Zones are distinct locations within a Region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones and that provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region.

By launching your instances in separate Regions, you can design your application to be closer to specific customers or to meet legal or other requirements. By launching your instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. Exchange provides infrastructure features that complement the high availability and disaster recovery scenarios supported in the AWS Cloud.

The architecture built by this Quick Start supports AWS best practices for high availability and security.

=== Automatic failover
Deploying this Quick Start with the default parameters configures an Auto Scaling Group with UIPath Orchestrator instances and three HAA clustered nodes or EC2 instances.

The Quick Start implementation supports the following:

* Protection from the failure of a single instance.
* Automatic failover between the HAA cluster nodes.
* Automatic failover between Availability Zones.

However, the Quick Start default implementation doesn’t provide automatic failover in every case. For example, the loss of Availability Zone 1 and Zone 2, which contains the primary and secondary HAA node, would prevent automatic failover to Availability Zone 3. This is because the cluster would fail as it loses quorum. In this scenario, you could follow manual disaster recovery steps that include rebuilding the cluster that is missing nodes. (At least two nodes must be available.)

To restore the HAA module, run the following command:
----
curl -fsSL  http://download.uipath.com/haa/get-haa.sh | bash -s -- -u username-available-node -p password-available-node -j ip-available-node
----
As a last resort, even if all nodes are lost, you can rebuild the entire HAA cluster. Then, the in-memory database is regenerated from the SQL database.

The Quick Start also provides an option to deploy into a minimum of two Availability Zones. This deployment option can mitigate the loss of quorum in the case of a failure of a single node. However, you can choose this option only in AWS Regions that include two or more Availability Zones. For a current list of Availability Zones, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Global Infrastructure].

To customize UiPath software for your business, IT, and security requirements, consult the https://docs.uipath.com/[UiPath Documentation Portal].

//Due to Autoscaling Group, Autoscaling Group rules (CloudWatch rules) and Launch Config, if any instance of Orchestrator is down, another one is being created in the desired state as long as NuGet packages are stored in S3 or any shared storage and DB is RDS type.

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

=== Security groups and firewalls
When the EC2 instances are launched, they must be associated with a security group, which acts as a stateful firewall. You have complete control over the network traffic entering or leaving the security group. You can build granular rules that are scoped by protocol, port number, and source, destination IP address, or subnet. By default, all outbound traffic from security group is permitted. Inbound traffic, however, must be configured to allow the appropriate traffic to reach your instances.

We recommend that you tightly control inbound traffic. Doing this reduces the attack surface of your EC2 instances yet leaves the following ports open for application communication.

* *HAA ports*

:xrefstyle: short
[#security1]
.HAA ports
image::../images/security1.png[security1,width=100%,height=100%]

* *Orchestrator and robot ports*
** 80, 443 for instances behind ALB
** 443 for ALB and Robots
** 3389 for Robots and Orchestrators

* *Other ports and usage*
** 22 for SSH into HAA nodes
** 1433 for MSSQL 

* *EC2 storage gateway ports*
** 2049, 111, 20048, 35790, 49000, 54524 – NFS service

For UiPath Orchestrator security best practices, refer to https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/docs/security-best-practices[UiPath docs]

== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

AWS provides a set of building blocks (for example, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC) that you can use to provision infrastructure for your applications. However, some security capabilities, such as physical security, are the responsibility of AWS as highlighted in the AWS security whitepaper. Other areas, such as controlling access to applications, fall under the purview of the application developer and the tools provided in the Microsoft or Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

This Quick Start configures the following security groups for the UiPath stack (Robot or Orchestrator):
